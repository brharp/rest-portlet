REST Remote Portlet
===================

*This document is a work in progress.*

An implementation of the REST portlet specification as a JSR-168
portlet.



## Error Handling

Errors may occur in the remote portlet, or in the portal either due to
programming errors or misconfiguration.

Errors in the remote portlet are generally reported through an
appropriate HTTP response code. However, the error pages configured
for most servers (404 not found, etc) will not generally be suitable
for consumption by the portal (they will contain header and footer
sections, for example). The remote portlet provides error pages for
common HTTP error codes that work properly within the portal context.

Errors in the portal due to misconfiguration result in a suitably
precise exception being thrown. These exceptions trigger an error page
that describes the problem in detail and aims to help resolve the
misconfiguration.

Unexpected errors due to programming bugs or unrecoverable situations
result in a general exception, which triggers an all-purpose error
page. This error page may contain general or technical information
that may only be of significance to the portal developer.
