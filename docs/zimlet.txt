REST Portlet is integrated with the Zimbra Zimlet API. 

Portlet requests are handled by render.jsp and processAction.jsp. The JSP 
files invoke Java classes to proxy requests to the remote portlet, 
and transform the results into a format suitable for the Zimlet.

Portlet scheme URLs are transformed into javascript: URLs that call the 
render() and processAction() methods.  These methods submit new 
asynchronous requests to the remote portlet and replace the window
contents dynamically.  The only exceptions are form actions: these
are rewritten to submit the form data in an onSubmit Javascript handler,
which must return false to prevent regular form submission (which would
replace the top level frame.)
